This is a project which focus on Realized Volatility Predication. As we the volatility make a very important role in 
derivative pricing and hedging. 
This project use overall 14 models(including Garch, Realized Garch, EGarch, RW, EWMA and so on) to predict 
the Realized Volatility in stock indexs which belongs to 12 countries. The result is international and consistent.  
And we compare the accuracy of prediction of these models and conclude some valuable results which may help when we predict the realized Vol in our furture work
